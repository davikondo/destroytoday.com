    <p><strong><img src="/assets/sabbatical.jpg" alt="sabbatical"></strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I picked up a heavy stream of client work that I just couldn’t turn down. A couple of the projects were delayed, aligning all of their deadlines to form the perfect storm. After about two months straight of working days, nights, and weekends, I wrapped up every last one of them. I was exhausted. I needed rest.</p>

<p>Luckily, that overload of client work padded my bank account enough so that I could take some time off. The original plan was to devote a month to getting my life back in order again, both mentally and physically. I would start exercising, reading, and socializing again. I spent too much time heads-down at my computer and not enough time away from it. This was my chance. But instead of one month, I ended up taking off three.</p>

<h3>Forced time off</h3>

<p>With no agenda, I began establishing routines. I joined a gym (and actually went) and set up a weekly email for basketball in Brooklyn, playing every weekend and occasionally throughout the week. I started each morning with a cup of pour over coffee at home and often rolled into the studio around 11. For the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel in a rush to get anywhere.</p>

<p>After a week without work, however, I felt fully rested and ready to dive back in. The most surprising and unexpected realization to come out of this sabbatical is that I didn’t need three months—I didn’t even need one. I know now that a single week is all I need to reset after a long sprint. I could’ve returned to work early, but I refrained from doing so. I forced myself to take more time off, as if it were mandatory.</p>

<h3>Just say no to clients</h3>

<p>I also forced myself to say no to any client gig that came my way, no matter how tempting the opportunity—I simply said I was on sabbatical. Instead of worrying about missing out, I felt empowered. I had a confindence and restraint that I don’t think I’ve ever had since I started freelancing. And aside from feeling like a total badass, I also witnessed a shift in how clients responded to the news. “Taking time off” is one thing, but being “on sabbatical” carries a lot more weight. Now, instead of clients coming to me with a deadline, they wanted to work around my schedule.</p>

<p>Another week went by and the urge to return grew stronger. I don’t take vacations very often, if at all, because I can’t <em>stay</em> on vacation. If I’m away from the studio for a week, on day 2, I have enough ideas to leave me itching to get back. This sabbatical was no different. Leading into it, I formed the idea for <a href="http://cushionapp.com">Cushion</a>, a freelancer tool that would bring peace of mind to those on their own. The main reason behind it is to help avoid those hectic months that encouraged the sabbatical—I should’ve seen the storm coming and planned accordingly, so I wouldn&rsquo;t need to take so much time off. With this new idea brewing, my vacation from work became a vacation from just client work. </p>

<h3>The need for variety</h3>

<p>I was heads-down at my desk again working on this new app. The first few weeks were amazing—working on a personal project full-time feels like I got away with something. After a while, though, I realized that I <em>need</em> client work to bring variety back to the table, along with challenges other than my own. Knowing exactly what I’ll be working on day after day is one of the reasons I quit my job. The appeal of freelancing is that every day could be completely different from the next.</p>

<p>This need grew. The more I worked on the app, the more I looked forward to client work. I now see client work as an essential ingredient to my productivity. When I’m obligated to work on a client project, I become really good at utilizing the time I’m not working on it. 7pm no longer means it’s time to call it a day—it now means that I have a good five hours to work on something else. I know this isn’t a healthy way to think, but I also know that I’m happiest when I’m producing good work.</p>

<h3>Planning the return</h3>

<p>With a few weeks remaining, I started to plan the months to follow—finally accepting client work again and preparing to ramp up. This time around, however, I wore this new sense of confidence—I felt more prepared than ever before. I realized that when I pause client work, I can clearly see what I need to do differently.</p>

<p>I decided to rethink how I approach client work. With Cushion as my primary focus, I could afford to take on less. Instead of stacking project upon project, leading to that perfect storm, I could settle with one at a time. This way, I wouldn’t need to take another sabbatical.</p>

<h3>The Cost</h3>

<p>In the end, this 3-month sabbatical cost me $23,116.46. Granted it included trips to Portland and Iceland, it was still a huge financial hit to my wallet. As a freelancer, I’ve grown an incredibly thick skin to news like this, so I took a deep breath and just accepted it. I’ve always wanted to take a sabbatical and I finally did it, but now I know I could just escape for a week in a brand new car instead.</p>

<p>A friend of mine and designer at Dropbox, <a href="http://twitter.com/colin_dunn">Colin Dunn</a>, reached out to me in January. He asked if I would mind him referring me to one of their project managers, <a href="http://twitter.com/prestontweets">Preston Hershorn</a>, for an upcoming gig. Of course, I didn’t mind.</p>

<p>We spoke a few times on the phone, discussing a mystery project that needed a marketing website. I was fresh off of building the <a href="/work/fiftythree">Pencil website</a> for <a href="http://fiftythree.com">FiftyThree</a>, and interested in building more of these single-page websites with a touch of something special. These websites allowed me to return to my roots of experimenting with code while also serving an actual purpose.</p>

<p>I flew out to San Francisco to work in-house at Dropbox for a week. On the first day, I sat in on a team meeting to review the state of this mystery project, named “Carousel”. A few team members provided an overview of the branding, along with its history. They demo’d the app itself, their original idea for the website, and storyboards for the upcoming video. It was impressive to see such a large-scale project represented by such a determined team. There was no question they all believed in Carousel.</p>

<p>While at Dropbox HQ, I worked on the mobile website, which would step the viewer through several views. A stack of photos would fall, arranging each photo on the device, to fill in the app’s content. Several transitions would play out, demonstrating the app’s main draw—sharing photos. The photos would then return to a stack and prompt the viewer to download the app.</p>

<p>Since these steps felt very clear-cut, I decided to treat each one as a “slide”. Instead of using a traditional scroll, and adding yet another moving part to the already active page, I locked it in place. I then listened for touch events and advanced to the next step with any vertical movement longer than a thumb’s radius.</p>

<p>The designer, <a href="http://byalicelee.com">Alice Lee</a>, provided me with flats and we discussed possible transitions. I first used Chrome’s device emulator to test the website, but then moved to using an actual device. This helped in discovering a few key areas of improvement where we could tie the transitions closer to the gestures of the viewer. Since we were swiping up to advance, I wanted the content to feel like it was being pushed with the viewer’s thumb or finger—the logo would scale down in the direction of the swipe and the stack of photos would be pulled up from the bottom. </p>

<p>Originally, the stack of photos on the last slide returned to the bottom of the stage, but this felt unnatural, as if the photos were swimming against the current of the swipe. I reversed the positioning of the stack, placing them at the top of the stage, with the content below. Again, following the direction of the swipe, this adjustment really pulled the ending together. The last slide now appears to be the continuation of first slide.</p>

<p>I wrapped up the mobile website that week, with exception for a few content tweaks throughout the rest of the project. After returning home to Brooklyn, I started on the desktop version. Dropbox wanted a completely different experience from mobile, but they also made it clear they didn’t want a separate “m.carousel.com” subdomain. Considering the mobile version used CSS for all of the transitions, I knew I would need to start from scratch with the desktop’s stylesheet. I ended up using the same HTML as the mobile version, but swapping out the stylesheets based on media queries on the stylesheet tags.</p>

<p>The original design of the desktop website used scroll-based breakpoints to trigger each transition. The text would follow one-to-one with the scroll and the device would remain fixed. This worked, but with the constant movement of the text, the viewer would be forced to switch focus between the two sides of the page. I switched the text to a fixed position and animated it in parallel with the device. This felt better, but there was a lot of waiting between transitions—and the wait would grow longer with the height of the window.</p>

<p>With only a couple weeks left, we decided to scrap the triggered animations and start over. Instead of relying on harsh breakpoints, we would track the animation with the scroll. To soften the feel, I took a page out of my Flash days and added friction to the scroll. This allowed the animations to ease into place without feeling so jarring. A few people at Dropbox looked at the website and felt the animations needed to snap into place better. At that time, they were a bit loose—you could easily scrub through the entire animation with a couple swipes on the trackpad.</p>

<div class='video-outer'>
    <div class='video-inner' style='padding-bottom: 77%'>
        <video width="100%" poster="/assets/carousel-conversation.jpg" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" controls="controls" tabindex="0">
            <source src="/assets/carousel-conversation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            <source src="/assets/carousel-conversation.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
            Video tag not supported. Download the video <a href="/assets/carousel-conversation.mp4">here</a>.
        </video>
    </div>
</div>

<p>I definitely didn’t want to return to the triggered approach from before, so I improvised. Since I was already using friction for a softer feel, I could simply increase the friction based on the scroll’s proximity to each lockpoint. In the code, I call these “speed bumps” and that’s exactly what they are. And, to make these speed bumps less apparent, I ease the friction based on the actual distance. This was enough to achieve the slick movement of the transitions while snapping each slide into place.</p>

<p>In the final week, there were several more revisions to the content. Initially, the desktop version had twice as many transitions, with each one split into separate parts. The second slide would swipe the screen up to portray a greater collection of photos. The third slide would transition into the conversation view with a fourth slide for easing the second message in from the bottom. We simplified these transitions by combining them, one by one, until we were left with three essential slides.</p>

<p>At launch, I let out a great sigh of relief. This project took a lot out of me because it consisted of countless technical challenges and several changes in direction late in the game. I’m happy with the end result, though. If we settled at any point instead of pushing through the difficult decisions, I think we would have been left with regret. Looking back, I’m incredibly grateful and fortunate that such a small gesture on Colin’s part, of putting my name in the hat, led to this collaboration.</p>

<p>This weekend, I registered a new domain name and published a new website—<a href="http://cushionapp.com">cushionapp.com</a>. For the past few months, I’ve been nurturing an idea. This idea started as a simple <a href="http://dstry.it/TVi6">prototype</a> for seeing how long a freelancer could coast, based on their income applied to their monthly expenses. I shared this idea with the late night Twitter crowd and discovered that <a href="https://twitter.com/destroytoday/status/425496976294412288">they liked it</a>, too. I could feel I was onto something.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I shaped the idea. I started thinking about my day-to-day as a freelancer and wondered what would make it easier. Considering the original idea, I thought about breaking income into three types—deposited, pending, and potential—then, <a href="http://dstry.it/UGwQ">mapping</a> them over time. I thought about my existing projects and how I wished I could <a href="http://dstry.it/UQxb">track</a> when they were delayed or dragged on too long. I thought about potential projects and what it would be like if I could visually <a href="http://dstry.it/UUN2">weigh</a> the pros and cons. After designing several of these prototypes, I realized just how much I needed this app.</p>

<p>The decision to commit was easy, but I also made another decision—to go on this trip alone. When I first started building apps, like <a href="/work/destroyflickr">DestroyFlickr</a> and <a href="/work/destroytwitter">DestroyTwitter</a>, I worked by myself, so I had free reign to take them wherever I wanted to go. Instead of focusing on the same features that every other app already had, I would experiment. I would implement the kind of features that none of the bigger apps would ever bother adding. And, sometimes, those unique features would be what set my apps apart from the rest.</p>

<p>With Cushion, I also want to focus on its feel and make it as personal an experience as possible. Rather than aim for unbelievable growth, I’d like to establish Cushion as a independent app, where users can have a direct connection to the person behind it. By creating an account, you are also creating a relationship. </p>

<p>My dad is a freelance book cover illustrator. He started right out of college and has been pushing out covers ever since—about 37 years now. If you’ve ever been in a book store, you’ve seen one of his covers. If you’ve walked past a cardboard box on the street with a stack of books in it, you’ve seen one of his covers.</p>

<p>The project started out with a meeting at the FiftyThree office—a beautiful loft in Tribeca. <a href="http://twitter.com/kjchun">KJ Chun</a> walked me through the design he prepared for the page and <a href="http://twitter.com/heavymeta">Ian Curry</a> showed me a few interaction prototypes for the fancier sections. I wore the serious professional face, but on the inside, I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve, and Santa was giving me a sneak peek at all my presents.</p>

<p>The Pencil product page was my first foray into scrolling effects—no pressure. I’ve never been a fan of scrolling effects, mainly because most implementations hijack the scrollbar. With that in mind, I coded it in a way that would maintain the integrity of the scroll, while still surprising the viewer. I wanted the parts to reveal themselves as if you could feel them sliding out. The animation works when resizing the window as well, so if you drag from the bottom, you can actually pull the pencil apart.</p>

<p>The “Inspired Form” section was originally designed to rotate the pencil with the horizontal tracking of the cursor, but it felt unnatural. If someone were to scroll the entirety of the page, they might miss it, as it required them to stop and move their cursor perpendicular to the scroll. As an alternative, I experimented with scrolling to rotate the pencil, so everyone would discover it. The pencil starts by facing left and rotates a full 180 degrees, exposing the front of the pencil half-way through. Luckily, this accomplished the natural feel I’m always aiming for in my work.</p>

<p>The page is fully responsive—even the scrolling effects. The FiftyThree team was open to suggestions on how to reflow the content across each breakpoint. I took a few cues from their existing product pages for consistency, but also tried a couple new directions of my own.</p>

<p>After a long week, I handed the code off to <a href="http://twitter.com/tfeener">Tara Feener</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/gscottolson">Scott Olson</a>, who prepared it for production. Not knowing when it would launch, I continued with my other work, but kept an eye on the site. A few Twitter mentions started to roll in and I knew it was live. I couldn’t be happier with the end result, as well as the response. It was an absolute privilege working with the FiftyThree team and tagging along for a small part of their adventure.</p>

<p>Like many internet dwellers, I prefer to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format">GIFs</a> as a form of response rather than words. Why <em>say</em> you’re angry when you can <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/121678/gifs/wwf-wrestling-girl-mad.gif">show it</a>. On Twitter, I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/garbnzgh/status/340135598700498944">quick</a> to respond with a GIF, which catches most people off guard—they wonder how I found an appropriate GIF so fast. Some <a href="https://twitter.com/dezinezync/status/345745470959792128">assume</a> I already have the URL copied to my clipboard, and this is partly true, but how did it get there? In this post, I’ll walk through my GIF workflow, detailing how I combine Dropbox and Alfred to optimize my TTGIF, or <em>time to GIF</em>.</p>

<p>Like many designers, I have a tendency to outgrow my website as soon as I finish redesigning it. “This time, I’ll do it right,” I say to myself. But as soon as I start, my excitement to finish leads me to cut corners and hack together a poor excuse of a website just so I can add new content again. This is my downfall. I’m left with poorly written code that eats at me every time I even think of my site. I no longer feel motivated to update it, but instead, I feel compelled to redesign it.</p>

<p>Early last year, I started renting a desk at <a href="http://studiomates.com">Studiomates</a> while working remotely for Adobe. With the majority of mates either running their own companies or freelancing, I felt the itch to follow suit. This feeling has been with me ever since I first started working for someone else. I knew that one day it would be too much to bear.</p>

    <p>On the 15th, I became a married man. An inordinate amount of work went into this wedding to ensure that it matched us as a couple in every way, and luckily, everything went without a hitch. I’m a dev at heart, so in the planning, I took it upon myself to be creative where I could. I utilized several services and even experimented with some of the newer web tech out there. In this post, I’ll run through the ‘backend’ of our wedding and provide detail on exactly what went into it.</p>
