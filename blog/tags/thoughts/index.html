    <p>The end of this year really crept up on me. I spent most of it heads-down working, so I didn’t even think of writing a year-in-review post until the last possible day. I wrote one for <a href="/blog/2012-a-year-in-review">2012</a> and it felt good to look back at past accomplishments, but I feel like 2014 was just a work-in-progress year for me. Because of this, I’m going to focus on the upcoming year instead and list a few things I want to accomplish.</p>

<h3>Ship Cushion</h3>

<p>If you don’t know about <a href="http://cushionapp.com">Cushion</a>, I’m surprised. Not because you <em>should</em> know about it, but more because I feel like it’s all I talk about anymore. Cushion is the freelancer app I’ve been working on day and night for most of the year. 3 months ago, I rolled out a <a href="http://cushionapp.com/beta">paid beta</a> and I hope to publicly launch in the next month or so. </p>

<h3>Use spreadsheets</h3>

<p>When I started working on Cushion, I made a point to be transparent, so I started tracking its <a href="http://cushionapp.com/expenses">expenses</a> in a spreadsheet. I can’t remember the last time I seriously used a spreadsheet, but I instantly rediscovered how powerful they can be. Coincidentally, my frustration with accounting software has reached defcon 1—I’m essentially paying $30/month for stress. I realized I could save that money and build a custom-tailored system using a simple spreadsheet. It’ll require a bit more manual work, but I’m certain I’ll sleep better at night.</p>

<h3>Continue existing routines</h3>

<p>Coming off my <a href="/blog/sabbatical">sabbatical</a> in June, I decided to establish a few routines. The first was to limit client work to 3 days a week. With Cushion bringing in an income of its own now, this routine has been a possibility for the past few months. The second routine was an uphill battle—getting a gym membership and actually going. I discovered that pairing routines increases the likelyhood that they will succeed, so after a long day of client work, I head straight to the gym. I’m proud to say this routine is on its 4th month and staying strong. *<em>rimshot</em>*</p>

<h3>One week between client gigs</h3>

<p>This past year, I had a serious problem with overlapping client jobs, resulting in the need to take 3 months off to fully recover. I’d like to avoid another burnout, so I’m establishing a new rule for myself—one week off between client gigs. This is much easier said than done, considering the delay and drag of projects are outside of my control, but I’m going to give it a shot and hope for the best.</p>

<h3>Book a few speaking gigs</h3>

<p>I had a few small talks in 2014 and it was a lot of fun. I’d really like to speak more, but I’m not sure where to start—I have a lot on my mind when it comes to freelancing, bootstrapping, and working solo. Speaking in front of a crowd once scared me to death, but now I enjoy it and feel I can contribute a lot—specifically jokes that bomb.</p>

<h3>Take more photos</h3>

<p>Every year, I tell myself I’m going to take photos more consistently, but I always fail. It’s the first thing to go when work picks up. I’m keeping this one on the list, though, because I still think it’s important—I’m always thankful when I have photos to match memories. After a year-long break from Instagram, I plan to return tomorrow. Maybe sharing photos will encourage me to shoot more often.</p>

<h3>Read more books</h3>

<p>Before we moved our studio space to within walking distance of our apartment, I was a subway reader. Now, I need to set aside time if I want to read. I hate that I’ve become accustom to reading headlines and collecting browser tabs of articles I’ll never read. To fight this, I’m going to first try getting in bed earlier and reading before sleep. Then, I might turn coffee time into coffee/reading time. I think it’d go a long way in improving how I feel about my consumption habits.</p>

<h3>Play more video games</h3>

<p>At some point in my adulthood, I stopped playing and just decided that I would work day and night. All the video games I once played just sat on the shelf and gathered dust—I forgot what it was like to really get into a game. Jen recently convinced me to buy a PS4 (which didn’t take much convincing at all), so we’ve been getting back into it. Every other night, we’ll set aside our work and take turns playing our game. I’m currently on Grand Theft Auto 5, with The Last of Us next in the queue, while Jen continues the Assassin’s Creed series. I can’t wait to see which games come out in 2015.</p>

<h3>Ride my bike</h3>

<p>I bought a Linus bike a few summers ago with the best intentions, but didn’t ride it much beyond a few commutes to the studio. With so much to see in New York, I feel I’m doing a disservice to myself for not riding on a regular basis. After living here for close to 3 years, I honestly haven’t ventured far beyond my own neighborhood. When spring arrives, however, I can’t wait to explore.</p>

<h3>Take a trip outside of Brooklyn every 3 months</h3>

<p>Along with seeing more of the city, I need to see more outside the city. Today especially, I realized I rarely take time off. My friend Frank <a href="https://twitter.com/anotherny/status/550381159658835971">suggested</a> blocking out time in my calendar every 3 months to just get out of the city. Well, I marked my calendar and I’m determined to stick to it—even if it just means a drive upstate. We’ve gone on a few trips last year with our fellow studiomates and now I’m itching to plan a few of my own.</p>

    <p><strong><img src="/assets/sabbatical.jpg" alt="sabbatical"></strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I picked up a heavy stream of client work that I just couldn’t turn down. A couple of the projects were delayed, aligning all of their deadlines to form the perfect storm. After about two months straight of working days, nights, and weekends, I wrapped up every last one of them. I was exhausted. I needed rest.</p>

<p>Luckily, that overload of client work padded my bank account enough so that I could take some time off. The original plan was to devote a month to getting my life back in order again, both mentally and physically. I would start exercising, reading, and socializing again. I spent too much time heads-down at my computer and not enough time away from it. This was my chance. But instead of one month, I ended up taking off three.</p>

<h3>Forced time off</h3>

<p>With no agenda, I began establishing routines. I joined a gym (and actually went) and set up a weekly email for basketball in Brooklyn, playing every weekend and occasionally throughout the week. I started each morning with a cup of pour over coffee at home and often rolled into the studio around 11. For the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel in a rush to get anywhere.</p>

<p>After a week without work, however, I felt fully rested and ready to dive back in. The most surprising and unexpected realization to come out of this sabbatical is that I didn’t need three months—I didn’t even need one. I know now that a single week is all I need to reset after a long sprint. I could’ve returned to work early, but I refrained from doing so. I forced myself to take more time off, as if it were mandatory.</p>

<h3>Just say no to clients</h3>

<p>I also forced myself to say no to any client gig that came my way, no matter how tempting the opportunity—I simply said I was on sabbatical. Instead of worrying about missing out, I felt empowered. I had a confindence and restraint that I don’t think I’ve ever had since I started freelancing. And aside from feeling like a total badass, I also witnessed a shift in how clients responded to the news. “Taking time off” is one thing, but being “on sabbatical” carries a lot more weight. Now, instead of clients coming to me with a deadline, they wanted to work around my schedule.</p>

<p>Another week went by and the urge to return grew stronger. I don’t take vacations very often, if at all, because I can’t <em>stay</em> on vacation. If I’m away from the studio for a week, on day 2, I have enough ideas to leave me itching to get back. This sabbatical was no different. Leading into it, I formed the idea for <a href="http://cushionapp.com">Cushion</a>, a freelancer tool that would bring peace of mind to those on their own. The main reason behind it is to help avoid those hectic months that encouraged the sabbatical—I should’ve seen the storm coming and planned accordingly, so I wouldn&rsquo;t need to take so much time off. With this new idea brewing, my vacation from work became a vacation from just client work. </p>

<h3>The need for variety</h3>

<p>I was heads-down at my desk again working on this new app. The first few weeks were amazing—working on a personal project full-time feels like I got away with something. After a while, though, I realized that I <em>need</em> client work to bring variety back to the table, along with challenges other than my own. Knowing exactly what I’ll be working on day after day is one of the reasons I quit my job. The appeal of freelancing is that every day could be completely different from the next.</p>

<p>This need grew. The more I worked on the app, the more I looked forward to client work. I now see client work as an essential ingredient to my productivity. When I’m obligated to work on a client project, I become really good at utilizing the time I’m not working on it. 7pm no longer means it’s time to call it a day—it now means that I have a good five hours to work on something else. I know this isn’t a healthy way to think, but I also know that I’m happiest when I’m producing good work.</p>

<h3>Planning the return</h3>

<p>With a few weeks remaining, I started to plan the months to follow—finally accepting client work again and preparing to ramp up. This time around, however, I wore this new sense of confidence—I felt more prepared than ever before. I realized that when I pause client work, I can clearly see what I need to do differently.</p>

<p>I decided to rethink how I approach client work. With Cushion as my primary focus, I could afford to take on less. Instead of stacking project upon project, leading to that perfect storm, I could settle with one at a time. This way, I wouldn’t need to take another sabbatical.</p>

<h3>The Cost</h3>

<p>In the end, this 3-month sabbatical cost me $23,116.46. Granted it included trips to Portland and Iceland, it was still a huge financial hit to my wallet. As a freelancer, I’ve grown an incredibly thick skin to news like this, so I took a deep breath and just accepted it. I’ve always wanted to take a sabbatical and I finally did it, but now I know I could just escape for a week in a brand new car instead.</p>

<p>This weekend, I registered a new domain name and published a new website—<a href="http://cushionapp.com">cushionapp.com</a>. For the past few months, I’ve been nurturing an idea. This idea started as a simple <a href="http://dstry.it/TVi6">prototype</a> for seeing how long a freelancer could coast, based on their income applied to their monthly expenses. I shared this idea with the late night Twitter crowd and discovered that <a href="https://twitter.com/destroytoday/status/425496976294412288">they liked it</a>, too. I could feel I was onto something.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I shaped the idea. I started thinking about my day-to-day as a freelancer and wondered what would make it easier. Considering the original idea, I thought about breaking income into three types—deposited, pending, and potential—then, <a href="http://dstry.it/UGwQ">mapping</a> them over time. I thought about my existing projects and how I wished I could <a href="http://dstry.it/UQxb">track</a> when they were delayed or dragged on too long. I thought about potential projects and what it would be like if I could visually <a href="http://dstry.it/UUN2">weigh</a> the pros and cons. After designing several of these prototypes, I realized just how much I needed this app.</p>

<p>The decision to commit was easy, but I also made another decision—to go on this trip alone. When I first started building apps, like <a href="/work/destroyflickr">DestroyFlickr</a> and <a href="/work/destroytwitter">DestroyTwitter</a>, I worked by myself, so I had free reign to take them wherever I wanted to go. Instead of focusing on the same features that every other app already had, I would experiment. I would implement the kind of features that none of the bigger apps would ever bother adding. And, sometimes, those unique features would be what set my apps apart from the rest.</p>

<p>With Cushion, I also want to focus on its feel and make it as personal an experience as possible. Rather than aim for unbelievable growth, I’d like to establish Cushion as a independent app, where users can have a direct connection to the person behind it. By creating an account, you are also creating a relationship. </p>

<p>My dad is a freelance book cover illustrator. He started right out of college and has been pushing out covers ever since—about 37 years now. If you’ve ever been in a book store, you’ve seen one of his covers. If you’ve walked past a cardboard box on the street with a stack of books in it, you’ve seen one of his covers.</p>

<p>When I turned seven years old, my family moved from the city of Allentown to the suburbs of Macungie. Our house was one of the first built in the development, with a quarter-acre backyard consisting of only dirt and rock. My mom spent most of her time transforming it into a typical yard in the suburbs—full of healthy grass and tall trees lining the perimeter. One day, she found a flat rock the size of a seat and placed it upon one of the tree beds. Mom called that our “thinking rock.” Whenever we needed some alone time to think, we could walk to the back of the yard and sit on it. I still remember it for that purpose. To anyone else, it is a rock, but to my mom, it is a place for thinking.</p>

<p>Last night, I hosted an event for designers and devs at <a href="http://studiomates.com">Studiomates</a> to gather and ask me any questions they might have about code. The purpose was to provide everyone with in-person help, to answer those questions that are difficult to find, or learn, through Google or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.

<p>Early last year, I started renting a desk at <a href="http://studiomates.com">Studiomates</a> while working remotely for Adobe. With the majority of mates either running their own companies or freelancing, I felt the itch to follow suit. This feeling has been with me ever since I first started working for someone else. I knew that one day it would be too much to bear.</p>

<p>It is late on the first of January, almost the second, but I’m determined to get this post up before it is too late. Today might even be too late, but I think it’s important to have something written for this past year, especially for this past year. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>An app called <a href="http://stamped.com">Stamped</a> launched earlier this week and immediately caught my eye. The concept of ‘stamping’ something you like didn’t wow me, but I did fall in love with the idea of personalizing yourself through a stamp color. Many apps and services these days rely solely on a username and avatar to distinguish users from one another. Because of this, signing up with a new network feels almost routine. When signing up with Stamped, however, I was caught off guard.</p>
