      <title>Lessons learned on a 3‑month sabbatical</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sabbatical.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sabbatical&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I picked up a heavy stream of client work that I just couldn’t turn down. A couple of the projects were delayed, aligning all of their deadlines to form the perfect storm. After about two months straight of working days, nights, and weekends, I wrapped up every last one of them. I was exhausted. I needed rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, that overload of client work padded my bank account enough so that I could take some time off. The original plan was to devote a month to getting my life back in order again, both mentally and physically. I would start exercising, reading, and socializing again. I spent too much time heads-down at my computer and not enough time away from it. This was my chance. But instead of one month, I ended up taking off three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Forced time off&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no agenda, I began establishing routines. I joined a gym (and actually went) and set up a weekly email for basketball in Brooklyn, playing every weekend and occasionally throughout the week. I started each morning with a cup of pour over coffee at home and often rolled into the studio around 11. For the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel in a rush to get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week without work, however, I felt fully rested and ready to dive back in. The most surprising and unexpected realization to come out of this sabbatical is that I didn’t need three months—I didn’t even need one. I know now that a single week is all I need to reset after a long sprint. I could’ve returned to work early, but I refrained from doing so. I forced myself to take more time off, as if it were mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Just say no to clients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also forced myself to say no to any client gig that came my way, no matter how tempting the opportunity—I simply said I was on sabbatical. Instead of worrying about missing out, I felt empowered. I had a confindence and restraint that I don’t think I’ve ever had since I started freelancing. And aside from feeling like a total badass, I also witnessed a shift in how clients responded to the news. “Taking time off” is one thing, but being “on sabbatical” carries a lot more weight. Now, instead of clients coming to me with a deadline, they wanted to work around my schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week went by and the urge to return grew stronger. I don’t take vacations very often, if at all, because I can’t &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; on vacation. If I’m away from the studio for a week, on day 2, I have enough ideas to leave me itching to get back. This sabbatical was no different. Leading into it, I formed the idea for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cushionapp.com&quot;&gt;Cushion&lt;/a&gt;, a freelancer tool that would bring peace of mind to those on their own. The main reason behind it is to help avoid those hectic months that encouraged the sabbatical—I should’ve seen the storm coming and planned accordingly, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to take so much time off. With this new idea brewing, my vacation from work became a vacation from just client work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The need for variety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was heads-down at my desk again working on this new app. The first few weeks were amazing—working on a personal project full-time feels like I got away with something. After a while, though, I realized that I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; client work to bring variety back to the table, along with challenges other than my own. Knowing exactly what I’ll be working on day after day is one of the reasons I quit my job. The appeal of freelancing is that every day could be completely different from the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This need grew. The more I worked on the app, the more I looked forward to client work. I now see client work as an essential ingredient to my productivity. When I’m obligated to work on a client project, I become really good at utilizing the time I’m not working on it. 7pm no longer means it’s time to call it a day—it now means that I have a good five hours to work on something else. I know this isn’t a healthy way to think, but I also know that I’m happiest when I’m producing good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Planning the return&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a few weeks remaining, I started to plan the months to follow—finally accepting client work again and preparing to ramp up. This time around, however, I wore this new sense of confidence—I felt more prepared than ever before. I realized that when I pause client work, I can clearly see what I need to do differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to rethink how I approach client work. With Cushion as my primary focus, I could afford to take on less. Instead of stacking project upon project, leading to that perfect storm, I could settle with one at a time. This way, I wouldn’t need to take another sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this 3-month sabbatical cost me $23,116.46. Granted it included trips to Portland and Iceland, it was still a huge financial hit to my wallet. As a freelancer, I’ve grown an incredibly thick skin to news like this, so I took a deep breath and just accepted it. I’ve always wanted to take a sabbatical and I finally did it, but now I know I could just escape for a week in a brand new car instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Experiments</title>
      <link>http://destroytoday.com/blog/experiments</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://uptime.destroytoday.com&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uptime.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;uptime&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week in Iceland, I returned to Brooklyn on Monday. Knowing I leave for Portland on Sunday, I didn’t want to get back into the thick of things with &lt;a href=&quot;http://cushionapp.com&quot;&gt;Cushion&lt;/a&gt; just to have any work broken up and left for after the trip. Because of this, I decided to spend this week cleaning up and tackling long overdue to-dos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Experiments” section of my website was highest on my list. It existed in the previous version, but slipped through the cracks in the redesign. I can’t clearly describe this section, but all of the projects within follow a common theme—they don’t bring in money. I made them just because.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first project is a rewrite of an old one—&lt;a href=&quot;/experiments/uptime&quot;&gt;Uptime&lt;/a&gt;. Back when I was first learning Ruby, I thought I’d make a dead-simple app that did one thing—track the uptime of my website. That on its own is a bit boring, so I designed it in the style of warehouse injury signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With absolutely no experience with Ruby, I wrote the single-page app on &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;, which is the equivalent to building a LEGO house with a construction crew. This time around, with a few years of Ruby under my belt, I spent an afternoon and rebuilt it on the lightweight &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinatrarb.com&quot;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt; framework. I’m also now hosting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/destroytoday/uptime&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; on Github, in case anyone wants their own uptime page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, I stopped experimenting. Over the next few days, I plan to add a few more of my older “experiments” and continue posting more as I make them. I’m hoping it will bring more variety into my work schedule, allowing me to take the occasional afternoon to focus on a random idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building the Carousel website with Dropbox</title>
      <link>http://destroytoday.com/blog/building-the-carousel-website</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2014 13:30:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>Jonnie Hallman</author>
      <guid>http://destroytoday.com/blog/building-the-carousel-website</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/carousel-hero.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;carousel-hero&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine and designer at Dropbox, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/colin_dunn&quot;&gt;Colin Dunn&lt;/a&gt;, reached out to me in January. He asked if I would mind him referring me to one of their project managers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/prestontweets&quot;&gt;Preston Hershorn&lt;/a&gt;, for an upcoming gig. Of course, I didn’t mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke a few times on the phone, discussing a mystery project that needed a marketing website. I was fresh off of building the &lt;a href=&quot;/work/fiftythree&quot;&gt;Pencil website&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://fiftythree.com&quot;&gt;FiftyThree&lt;/a&gt;, and interested in building more of these single-page websites with a touch of something special. These websites allowed me to return to my roots of experimenting with code while also serving an actual purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew out to San Francisco to work in-house at Dropbox for a week. On the first day, I sat in on a team meeting to review the state of this mystery project, named “Carousel”. A few team members provided an overview of the branding, along with its history. They demo’d the app itself, their original idea for the website, and storyboards for the upcoming video. It was impressive to see such a large-scale project represented by such a determined team. There was no question they all believed in Carousel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='left video-outer' style='max-width: 300px'&gt;
    &lt;div class='video-inner' style='padding-bottom: 210%'&gt;
        &lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; poster=&quot;/assets/carousel-mobile.jpg&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/carousel-mobile.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/carousel-mobile.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot; /&gt;
            Video tag not supported. Download the video &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/carousel-mobile.mp4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at Dropbox HQ, I worked on the mobile website, which would step the viewer through several views. A stack of photos would fall, arranging each photo on the device, to fill in the app’s content. Several transitions would play out, demonstrating the app’s main draw—sharing photos. The photos would then return to a stack and prompt the viewer to download the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these steps felt very clear-cut, I decided to treat each one as a “slide”. Instead of using a traditional scroll, and adding yet another moving part to the already active page, I locked it in place. I then listened for touch events and advanced to the next step with any vertical movement longer than a thumb’s radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://byalicelee.com&quot;&gt;Alice Lee&lt;/a&gt;, provided me with flats and we discussed possible transitions. I first used Chrome’s device emulator to test the website, but then moved to using an actual device. This helped in discovering a few key areas of improvement where we could tie the transitions closer to the gestures of the viewer. Since we were swiping up to advance, I wanted the content to feel like it was being pushed with the viewer’s thumb or finger—the logo would scale down in the direction of the swipe and the stack of photos would be pulled up from the bottom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, the stack of photos on the last slide returned to the bottom of the stage, but this felt unnatural, as if the photos were swimming against the current of the swipe. I reversed the positioning of the stack, placing them at the top of the stage, with the content below. Again, following the direction of the swipe, this adjustment really pulled the ending together. The last slide now appears to be the continuation of first slide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='video-outer'&gt;
    &lt;div class='video-inner' style='padding-bottom: 77%'&gt;
        &lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; poster=&quot;/assets/carousel-intro.jpg&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/carousel-intro.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/carousel-intro.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot; /&gt;
            Video tag not supported. Download the video &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/carousel-intro.mp4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up the mobile website that week, with exception for a few content tweaks throughout the rest of the project. After returning home to Brooklyn, I started on the desktop version. Dropbox wanted a completely different experience from mobile, but they also made it clear they didn’t want a separate “m.carousel.com” subdomain. Considering the mobile version used CSS for all of the transitions, I knew I would need to start from scratch with the desktop’s stylesheet. I ended up using the same HTML as the mobile version, but swapping out the stylesheets based on media queries on the stylesheet tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original design of the desktop website used scroll-based breakpoints to trigger each transition. The text would follow one-to-one with the scroll and the device would remain fixed. This worked, but with the constant movement of the text, the viewer would be forced to switch focus between the two sides of the page. I switched the text to a fixed position and animated it in parallel with the device. This felt better, but there was a lot of waiting between transitions—and the wait would grow longer with the height of the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only a couple weeks left, we decided to scrap the triggered animations and start over. Instead of relying on harsh breakpoints, we would track the animation with the scroll. To soften the feel, I took a page out of my Flash days and added friction to the scroll. This allowed the animations to ease into place without feeling so jarring. A few people at Dropbox looked at the website and felt the animations needed to snap into place better. At that time, they were a bit loose—you could easily scrub through the entire animation with a couple swipes on the trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='video-outer'&gt;
    &lt;div class='video-inner' style='padding-bottom: 77%'&gt;
        &lt;video width=&quot;100%&quot; poster=&quot;/assets/carousel-conversation.jpg&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/carousel-conversation.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/carousel-conversation.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot; /&gt;
            Video tag not supported. Download the video &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/carousel-conversation.mp4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/video&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely didn’t want to return to the triggered approach from before, so I improvised. Since I was already using friction for a softer feel, I could simply increase the friction based on the scroll’s proximity to each lockpoint. In the code, I call these “speed bumps” and that’s exactly what they are. And, to make these speed bumps less apparent, I ease the friction based on the actual distance. This was enough to achieve the slick movement of the transitions while snapping each slide into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final week, there were several more revisions to the content. Initially, the desktop version had twice as many transitions, with each one split into separate parts. The second slide would swipe the screen up to portray a greater collection of photos. The third slide would transition into the conversation view with a fourth slide for easing the second message in from the bottom. We simplified these transitions by combining them, one by one, until we were left with three essential slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At launch, I let out a great sigh of relief. This project took a lot out of me because it consisted of countless technical challenges and several changes in direction late in the game. I’m happy with the end result, though. If we settled at any point instead of pushing through the difficult decisions, I think we would have been left with regret. Looking back, I’m incredibly grateful and fortunate that such a small gesture on Colin’s part, of putting my name in the hat, led to this collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On sabbatical</title>
      <link>http://destroytoday.com/blog/on-sabbatical</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2014 00:32:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <guid>http://destroytoday.com/blog/on-sabbatical</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I start my sabbatical. This is a first for me and, perhaps, an over-the-top reaction to the fact that I don’t take any time off, but I need it. With a first quarter consisting of nothing but client work, I know I need to slow down and give myself some time to reset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year started out promising, with a few potential gigs, but before long, each one fell through. I found myself going into February with only negative line items on my bank statement and not a single confirmed project. It was tough to endure, but something told me to wait it out—that these project didn’t pan out for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, all of a sudden, I reunited with a previous client, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chr.ma&quot;&gt;Chroma&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/colin_dunn&quot;&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; at Dropbox put in a good word for me. I had two confirmed projects and more than enough work to keep me busy until April. On top of that, Mailbox asked if I could take on their website as well. At this point, I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; had more than enough work to keep me busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a little under two months, I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://chr.ma&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://carousel.com&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailboxapp.com&quot;&gt;websites&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ableparris.com&quot;&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; for my friend. This resulted in an incredible number of late nights and long weekends, but also, enough income to provide a comfortable runway into summer. I considered taking on more client work, but then I stopped and realized—I should take this time and invest it in myself. What else could I do in two months?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I shift focus to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cushionapp.com&quot;&gt;Cushion&lt;/a&gt;, but I also start from scratch with my day-to-day routine. These past two months have proven that just because I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work on four websites simultaneousely doesn’t mean I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;. By the end of this sabbatical, I want to be excited to take on new work, but mindful in deciding how much is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/timeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I registered a new domain name and published a new website—&lt;a href=&quot;http://cushionapp.com&quot;&gt;cushionapp.com&lt;/a&gt;. For the past few months, I’ve been nurturing an idea. This idea started as a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://dstry.it/TVi6&quot;&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt; for seeing how long a freelancer could coast, based on their income applied to their monthly expenses. I shared this idea with the late night Twitter crowd and discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/destroytoday/status/425496976294412288&quot;&gt;they liked it&lt;/a&gt;, too. I could feel I was onto something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following weeks, I shaped the idea. I started thinking about my day-to-day as a freelancer and wondered what would make it easier. Considering the original idea, I thought about breaking income into three types—deposited, pending, and potential—then, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dstry.it/UGwQ&quot;&gt;mapping&lt;/a&gt; them over time. I thought about my existing projects and how I wished I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://dstry.it/UQxb&quot;&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; when they were delayed or dragged on too long. I thought about potential projects and what it would be like if I could visually &lt;a href=&quot;http://dstry.it/UUN2&quot;&gt;weigh&lt;/a&gt; the pros and cons. After designing several of these prototypes, I realized just how much I needed this app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to commit was easy, but I also made another decision—to go on this trip alone. When I first started building apps, like &lt;a href=&quot;/work/destroyflickr&quot;&gt;DestroyFlickr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/work/destroytwitter&quot;&gt;DestroyTwitter&lt;/a&gt;, I worked by myself, so I had free reign to take them wherever I wanted to go. Instead of focusing on the same features that every other app already had, I would experiment. I would implement the kind of features that none of the bigger apps would ever bother adding. And, sometimes, those unique features would be what set my apps apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cushion, I also want to focus on its feel and make it as personal an experience as possible. Rather than aim for unbelievable growth, I’d like to establish Cushion as a independent app, where users can have a direct connection to the person behind it. By creating an account, you are also creating a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/reubeningber&quot;&gt;Reuben Inger&lt;/a&gt; invited me to join him on his podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://howtoholdapencil.com/episode/017/&quot;&gt;How to Hold a Pencil&lt;/a&gt;, for an interview about how I started in the design/dev world. I also talked about taking the leap into freelancing and the fears and freedoms that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past December, I spoke at &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativemornings.com&quot;&gt;CreativeMornings&lt;/a&gt;, a breakfast lecture series for the creative community with 65 chapters worldwide and growing. The New York venue is located several blocks from my co-working space, &lt;a href=&quot;http://studiomates.com&quot;&gt;Studiomates&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m often in attendance. This time, however, I was fortunate enough to take the stage. Considering the month’s theme, “Make,” my talk focused on my dad and how he made me into the “maker” I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For an extended transcription of my talk, you can refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/my-dad&quot;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book covers, model airplanes, and my dad</title>
      <link>http://destroytoday.com/blog/my-dad</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is an extended transcription of my CreativeMornings talk, given on December 13th. The theme was “Make,” and instead of speaking about my own work, I decided to talk about my dad, his work, and how he turned me into the maker I am today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-covers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-covers&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad is a freelance book cover illustrator. He started right out of college and has been pushing out covers ever since—about 37 years now. If you’ve ever been in a book store, you’ve seen one of his covers. If you’ve walked past a cardboard box on the street with a stack of books in it, you’ve seen one of his covers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first 20 years, he painted each and every cover. He would take a few reference photos with his polaroid land camera and spend the following month painting with acrylics on a gessoed masonite board. Upon finishing, he would slip the cover in a Fedex box and ship it to his publisher in New York, hoping it would arrive in one piece. Now, my dad uses Photoshop. He can start a cover on a Friday and email it to his publisher on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my dad works from home, my siblings and I grew up watching him illustrate these covers. He greeted us in the morning from his studio and wished us goodnight from his studio. My dad burns the midnight oil better than anyone I know, which explains why working a 14-hour day sometimes feels normal to me. Some nights, we would work alongside each other in his studio, watching any given Philly game, with the audio from the local radio broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-polaroid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-polaroid&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because my parents live in the small town of Macungie, PA, my dad would ask us to pose for him rather than hiring models. At the time, there was nothing special about this—it was just part of our childhood. I would spend a few minutes looking like a boy without a family and he would pay me $20, which I could use towards my next video game. To a kid, this was a steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-lizzy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-lizzy&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posing for my dad was rarely planned—he would just call us over from his studio and ask us to spare a few minutes. The shoot often involved my mom holding a piece of foamcore as a makeshift reflector or picking out the correct attire for us. We would goof around, treating this like our own version of dress-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After holding still for a few shots, trying to make each other laugh while not laughing ourselves, we would go back to whatever we were doing. Then, several months later, we would find ourselves on another cover. This felt like magic. My dad doesn’t need green screens or professional lighting—he can make a cover out of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-sketches.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-sketches&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start a cover, one of my dad’s publishers would send him a sketch. The sketch was often more of a scribble than anything descriptive, so they would follow up the sketch with a call. The art director would chime in and provide a sketch of their own. This would typically be more elaborate, but still difficult for most to interpret. My dad had no problem, though. He would take these sketches and produce a cover with the exact image his publishers had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, his publishers would consistently return to him when they needed the job done right. This had a major impact on my own work ethic and the kind of relationships I try to build with others. If you establish yourself as someone who can always finish the job with a level of quality beyond expectations, you will never have trouble finding work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-airplanes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though my dad is at the top of his game with book covers, his true passion lies with model airplanes. When he wished us goodnight from his studio, he usually had an airplane in front of him rather than a cover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He started building airplanes at the age of eight, having learned from &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; dad. Back then, video games and computers didn’t exist (*&lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt;*), so models were a common hobby for the average kid. Hobby shops are rare these days, but if you can find one, there’s a good chance it will have a section for model airplanes. But, my dad doesn’t just build his airplanes from kits. He actually constructs them from scratch, and each one is an exact replica of an existing airplane from a previous era, mainly WWI and WWII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-bones.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-bones&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single airplane will take anywhere from two months to a year to complete. Each one is constructed from several sheets of balsa wood that are cut down to size and glued in place. The airplane is then wrapped in tissue paper and decorated with all the details of its original design. As a kid, I witnessed the daily progress of every plane—each one built as separate parts, then pieced together at the end. Now, I see progress in months, when I’m able to visit home. I’ll catch him either starting a new plane or putting the finishing touches on one I’ve seen only once or twice before. Nevertheless, he’s always excited to show me his latest creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-flying.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-flying&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building model airplanes requires enough work on its own to be considered a full-time job, let alone a hobby, but my dad isn’t the type to just shelf a piece of work and call it a day. Every airplane he builds can also fly as well as it looks. In his eyes, what’s a plane that can’t fly? He takes this very seriously, too, to the extent of mowing only a portion of his backyard, so the rest could remain a soft “landing strip” for testing and minor tweaking. He calls it “Hallman’s Meadow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-winder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-winder&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect by now, these airplanes aren’t RC-powered. Believe it or not, they fly on rubber band power. Inside each airplane is a greased rubber band running from a hook in the back to the propeller in the front. The length of the rubber band depends on the size of the airplane, with some reaching as long as several feet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winding one of these airplanes by hand would be very tiring, not to mention time-consuming, considering a single flight requires several hundred winds. Instead, my dad uses a makeshift winder. This MacGyver-esque device can wind ten times faster than using your hand. It also comes equipped with a calculator that keeps track of the number of winds, using a magnet that is literally taped to the crank. Surprising no one, you can’t buy these—he knows a guy who makes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/mass-launch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mass-launch&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad also competes as a member of the Flying Aces Club. He drives to either Geneseo or Wawayanda in upstate New York and flies against dozens of other “pilots”—each of whom has been building and flying airplanes for decades. They spend a few days competing, but also discussing their craft, process, and experiences from the past year’s build. Having been to several competitions as a kid, I can tell you that each one of these fliers wants nothing more than to share what they know and celebrate each other’s flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 59, my dad is considered the young gun among the other fliers, with most of them old enough to be &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; dad, but as a 5-time grand champion, he carries a strong reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-canopy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-canopy&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with constructing the actual airplanes, my dad also builds tools to help him make specific parts of each plane. One of these tools, he calls a “canopy vacuformer”, is a contraption that forms the canopy of an airplane from a single sheet of plastic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad places the top-half of the tool in his oven with the plastic securely held in place. The plastic is heated at a temperature between 300-350 degrees, until malleable. Then, he removes the plastic from the oven and places it on top of the balsa mold of the canopy. With the family vacuum, he suctions the plastic down to perfectly fit over the mold, forming the canopy of the airplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, growing up watching this process, I didn’t think twice about it—this was just how you build the canopy for a rubber band-powered model airplane. How else would you do it? Now, I truly appreciate the creativity and resourcefulness on my dad’s part to even think of a process like this, utlizing household appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-detail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-detail&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attention to detail my dad puts into every airplane is incredible. His obsession with even the most minute details is one that I often see in myself. Every time he reveals his latest workboard of airplane parts to me, I soak in every consideration he shares and admire the precision of each piece. Everything is always perfect. In my own work, I want people to feel the way I do when I see his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/my-dad-process.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my-dad-process&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While constructing an airplane, my dad takes the time to document the entire process, which is why I do the same with my own projects. I love seeing how each part comes together and how it contributes to the final product. Seeing this documentation as a kid, I learned its importance in telling the story of each airplane. I could witness the struggles, decisions and sacrifices that lead to the end result, making every airplane so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/mitsubishi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mitsubishi&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad’s airplanes are more than just airplanes. Each one is a piece of art and an extension of my dad. Though these planes don’t really matter in the grand scheme of things, they mean the world to him. He taught me everything I know about craftsmanship and what it’s like to be truly passionate about our work. And, I’m passionate about my work because of my dad.&lt;/p&gt;
